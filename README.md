## Patchwork Toolkit

### Lightweight Platform for the Network of Things (written in Golang)

Patchwork is a toolkit for connecting various devices into a network of things or, in a more broad case - Internet of Things (IoT). The main goal of creating this toolkit is having a lightweight set of components that can help to quickly integrate different devices (i.e. Arduinos, RaspberryPI’s, Plugwise, etc) into a smart environment and expose specific devices’ capabilities as RESTful/SOAP/CoAP/MQTT/etc services.
